          Welcome to andre.science! My name is Andre Mello, and the goal of
          this site is to share my passion for ML, math, and coding. It will feature 
          projects and what I'm learning. I hope you will get to learn
          something new from here. I've benefitted so much from other people's
          projects, their information, and their good will. I think it's time
          for me to start sharing what I find worthwhile as well. One of the reasons for starting this
          was the push by Jeremy Howward for personal blogging while going through his fast.ai course.

        <h2>About Andre</h2>
        <p class="main-text">
          I'm a Physics student at the University of British Columbia who graduates in December.
          I've always been passionate about Science and knew I wanted to work in
          STEM ever since I can remember. Initially, I wanted to pursue physics,
          but while doing my bachelors I was introduced to computer science and
          fell in love. I realized what I really loved about physics was the math,
          and computer science is actually closer to that passion. It was
          also great to see how much more directly practical it all was.
           Unfortunately, I only made
          the hard decision to change carreers after I was very close to
          finishing my degree, so I chose to finish in physics, but pursue a career in computer science.
           Both fields share quite a lot in technical thinking and
          skillset, so I believe I can make the transition well.

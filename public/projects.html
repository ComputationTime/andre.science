          <!-- Here are my favorite personal projects that I decided to write about. So far, I don't have many that I really like
          (I also don't have many personal projects since I am still fairly new to computer science and do most of it as a hobby aside 
          from my physics school work), but in the future I'll try to document them all here. Hopefully there are some cool things to 
          come. -->
          There's nothing here so far ðŸ¥² but just wait! The current projects I'm working on oulined in the learning section should start
           coming here soon! 
          For now, here's a picture of two puppies as an apology. If you have a suggestion for future projects, feel free to share them
          with me in the contact section. Hope you like the dogs better than cats. If not, oof.

            <p>This Microcontroller was the one used for one of my University courses on electronics. Prior to playing around
              with microcontrollers in a class where we had more freedom than ever in what we could build, I did not like 
              electronics much. In fact, my previous experience with them had been in the course I disliked the most in my life.
              I am glad I was given a second chance to uncover the beautiful world of electronics. I hope you will enjoy it too.

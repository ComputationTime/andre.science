        <h1>Learning</h1>
        <p class="main-text">You just clicked on one of my favorite parts of the website. It has what I'm currently 
          learning and working on. It's important to put what you learn to use in order to retain it, so 
          almost everything in this section that is immediately appliable will be eventually transitioned to the 
          projects section.

            <p>This Microcontroller was the one used for one of my University courses on electronics. Prior to playing around
              with microcontrollers in a class where we had more freedom than ever in what we could build, I did not like 
              electronics much. In fact, my previous experience with them had been in the course I disliked the most in my life.
              I am glad I was given a second chance to uncover the beautiful world of electronics. I hope you will enjoy it too.
